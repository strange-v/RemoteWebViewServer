# Remote WebView Server

Headless browser that renders target web pages (e.g., Home Assistant dashboards) and streams them as image tiles over WebSocket to lightweight [clients](https://github.com/strange-v/RemoteWebViewClient) (ESP32 displays).

## Features

- Renders pages in a headless Chromium environment and streams diffs as tiles over WebSocket.
- Tile merging with change detection to reduce packet count and CPU load
- Full-frame fallback on cadence/threshold or on demand
- Configurable tile size, JPEG quality, WS message size, and min frame interval
- Per-client settings: each connection can supply its own width, height, tileSize, jpegQuality, maxBytesPerMessage, etc.
- Hot reconfigure: reconnecting with new params reconfigures the device session and triggers a full-frame refresh.
- Smarter frame gating: throttling + content-hash dedup (skip identical frames)
- No viewers = no work: frames are ACK’d to keep Chromium streaming, but tiles aren’t encoded/queued when there are no listeners.
- Touch event bridging (down/move/up) — scrolling supported (no gestures yet)
- Client-driven navigation: the client can control which page to open.
- Built-in self-test page to visualize and measure render time
- Health endpoint for container orchestration
- Optional DevTools access via TCP proxy

## Accessing the server’s tab with Chrome DevTools
1. Make sure your server exposes the DevTools (CDP) port (e.g., 9222).
   - If you use a pure Docker container, make sure you have configured and started `debug-proxy`
   - If HA OS addon is used, enable `expose_debug_proxy`
1. In Chrome, go to chrome://inspect/#devices → Configure… → add your host: hostname_or_ip:9222.
1. You should see the page the server opened (the one you want to log into, e.g., Home Assistant). Click inspect to open a full DevTools window for that tab.

## Image Tags & Versioning

- latest — newest stable release
- beta — newest pre-release (rolling)
- Semantic versions: X.Y.Z, plus convenience tags X.Y, X on stable releases

You can pin a stable release (`1.4.0`) or track channels (`latest`, `beta`) depending on your deployment strategy.
